Self Evaluation

Functionality: I most likely fall into the 'below expectations' category for this one. I'm very close to getting my decrypt function working, but was not able to finish by the time it was due.

OOP: below expectations. I have way too much going on in my enigma class, but it's the only way I could make it run properly.

Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: meets expectations.

TDD: below expectations or well below. I struggled with figuring out how to write tests for my classes. The generation of random numbers, along with a changing date, and changing offsets threw me for a loop.

Git Workflow: below expectations. Did not reach 40 commits, and I only had one PR.
